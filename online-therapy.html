        </h5>
        <p>
          As the mental health community grows so has its ability to reach those
          that struggled to meet with therapists in their area. People that once
          struggled to book an appointment or had not considered in-person
          therapy due to social anxiety can now stay at home in bed and meet
          with a therapist. This greatly expands patients options to get
          treatment on mobile devices through apps such as BetterHelp, 7Cups,
          Lyra, etc. However as online therapy grows, incidents have caused
          people to question the effectiveness of online therapy such as the
          situation with BetterHelp in 2018 when its advertisers profited from
          those with mental illnesses (Matas, 2018). As online therapy grows and
          becomes a more popular option for those seeking treatment is it for
          everyone?
        </p>

        <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-5">Studies</h4>
        <p>
          Multiple studies have shown no significant differences between online
          therapy versus face-to-face therapy (Wagner (2014), Andrews (2018),
          and Nordgren (2014)). There have even been studies conducted that
          provide significant evidence for online therapy being slightly more
          effective than face-to-face therapy for those who are specifically
          seeking Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Sarkis (2020), Luo (2020)).
        </p>

        <h4 class="w3-left-align w3-padding-5">PROS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>No commute</li>
          <li>Ability to more freely communicate</li>
          <li>More variety of therapist</li>
          <li>No waiting rooms for those with social anxiety</li>
          <li>No formal wear</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="w3-left-align w3-padding-5">CONS</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Unable to be effective for certain conditions</li>
          <li>Technological issues</li>
          <li>
            Therapists will have a more difficult time creating a therapeutic
            alliance
          </li>
          <li>Some advertised people may not be licensed</li>
          <li>Difficulties intervening on a crisis</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="w3-center w3-padding-5">Personal Experience</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout my mental health journey I have been to both online and
          face-to-face therapy and prefer online therapy to face-to-face. I am
          not restricted to meeting with my therapist at a certain location and
          am able to schedule a call with whatever works with their
          availability. It has also allowed me to stay with the same therapist
          no matter where I go; for example, if I go on a vacation (like I am
          doing currently writing this) I will not have to postpone my therapy
          sessions. This has allowed me the freedom and helped my mental health
          journey as I used to move quite frequently and did not like to open up
          so frequently to new therapists. My therapist is super nice and though
          there are technical errors or sometimes static, I am still able to get
          the same quality and even better care by doing online therapy versus
          my experience doing face-to-face therapy.
